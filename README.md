# Transformer Model from Scratch in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements the Transformer architecture from scratch in PyTorch, following the original paper *"Attention is All You Need"* by Vaswani et al. The model is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and other NLP applications.

## Features
- Implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch
- Self-attention mechanism (Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention)
- Positional Encoding for sequence handling
- Layer Normalization and Feedforward Networks
- Encoder-Decoder structure
- Custom training loop for model optimization


## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib tqdm
```


## Model Architecture
The Transformer model consists of the following components:
- **Input Embedding:** Converts tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding:** Adds positional information to token embeddings.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Enables the model to focus on different parts of the sequence.
- **Feedforward Networks:** Enhances model expressiveness.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections:** Improves training stability.
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** Processes input sequences and generates output.


## Future Improvements
- Implement Transformer variants like BERT and GPT.
- Optimize training with mixed-precision techniques.
- Experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters.
